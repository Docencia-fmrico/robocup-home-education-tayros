  max_vel_x: 0.4  # 0.55

  max_vel_y: 0.0  # diff drive robot

  # Warning!
  #   do not set min_trans_vel to 0.0 otherwise dwa will always think translational velocities
  #   are non-negligible and small in place rotational velocities will be created.

  acc_lim_theta: 2.2
  acc_lim_y: 0.0      # diff drive robot

# Goal Tolerance Parameters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.1  # 0.05   ## The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal

# Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 4.0       # 1.7   ## The amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories in seconds

# Trajectory Scoring Parameters

  occdist_scale: 0.5            # 0.01   - weighting for how much the controller should avoid obstacles
  forward_point_distance: 0.425 # 0.325  - how far along to place an additional scoring point
  stop_time_buffer: 0.3         # 0.2    - amount of time a robot must stop in before colliding for a valid traj.
  scaling_speed: 0.15           # 0.25   - absolute velocity at which to start scaling the robot's footprint
  max_scaling_factor: 0.15      # 0.2    - how much to scale the robot's footprint when at speed.

# Oscillation Prevention Parameters
